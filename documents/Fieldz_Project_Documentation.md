## UI/UX Design System

### Design Principles

#### Color Scheme
The Fieldz application features a distinctive orange-based gradient color scheme that creates a warm, inviting visual experience throughout the app.

**Primary Gradient Theme:**
The signature gradient used across most pages (Login, Home, SignUp, and authentication screens) follows this pattern:
```dart
LinearGradient(
  begin: Alignment.topLeft,
  end: Alignment.bottomRight,
  colors: [
    Color.fromARGB(255, 232, 140, 87),    // Primary Orange
    Color.fromARGB(255, 243, 219, 171),    // Light Orange/Yellow
    Color.fromARGB(40, 234, 242, 214),     // Very Light Green (subtle)
  ],
  stops: [0.0, 0.35, 1.0],                  // Color distribution points
)
```

**Core Brand Colors:**
- **Primary Orange**: `Color.fromARGB(255, 232, 140, 87)` - The main brand color used for buttons, selected states, and accents
- **Secondary Orange**: `Color.fromRGBO(221, 149, 99, 1.0)` - Slightly darker variant for hover states and some UI elements
- **Notification Orange**: `Color.fromRGBO(220, 149, 100, 1.0)` - Used for notification indicators and alerts
- **Light Orange**: `Color.fromARGB(255, 243, 219, 171)` - Mid-gradient color providing warmth
- **Background Gray**: `Color.fromRGBO(235, 235, 235, 1.0)` - Light gray background for content areas
- **White**: `Colors.white` - Clean white for cards, forms, and text backgrounds
- **Text Black**: `Colors.black` - Primary text color for readability
- **Text Gray**: `Colors.grey` - Secondary text and placeholder text

**Gradient Applications:**
- **Header Containers**: The primary gradient creates visually appealing headers in Login, Home, and authentication pages
- **Background Overlays**: Used as decorative background elements with rounded corners
- **Button States**: Selected category buttons use the primary orange color
- **Loading Indicators**: SpinKit loading animations use the primary orange with transparency

**Color Usage Patterns:**
- **Interactive Elements**: Primary orange for buttons, selected items, and interactive components
- **Text Hierarchy**: Black for primary text, gray for secondary text, white for text on colored backgrounds
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Gradient backgrounds establish visual zones and guide user attention
- **Status Indicators**: Orange for notifications, warnings, and important actions

#### Typography
- Primary Font: Poppins
- Font Weights: Regular (400), Medium (500), Semibold (600), Bold (700)
